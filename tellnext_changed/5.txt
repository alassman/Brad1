Write 100 to 200 words about the Time Capsule and the skills you are hoping to learn in this course.


　　The Time Capsule was an extremely interesting group project we did on the first day of class. I particularly liked  this assignment because I was able to communicate a little better with the rest of the class. We were given instructions to create an object the size of a FedEx box and we had to, as a group, come up with a few reasons why this object was left in a Time Capsule. 
　　
　　We had to imagine that we were 3,000 years in the future; we had to find this box and pretend that we were archaeologists dealing with this box from 3,000 years in the past. I think we did extremely well on this group project because we all had various methods of interpretation which showed us the importance of preserving the different points of view in history. 

　　In this course I am hoping to learn the critical thinking  involved with the history of theatre. I think learning about history is very important because we all have ancestors that we would like to learn about and reflect on the societies they had established.
