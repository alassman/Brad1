Between the reading and the movie, how would you characterize Louise Beavers/Delilah?

I would characterize Delilah¡¯s performance as a Jesus figure. Her whole life has been in service to others; one aspect of her life led me to believe that she was a Jesus figure. Then, she dies in a very unknown way in her bed with Mary Magdalene or Beatrice by her side. Louis Beavers was one of the very few black women stars of Hollywood to perform regularly in movies in the 1930s. Her impression of a black nanny and servant was particularly appealing to the Production Code people of the South in the 1930s. 

Between the reading and the movie, how would you characterize Fredi Washington/Peola?

I would characterize Peola as one intelligent young girl.  Peola is smart because she is always figuring out the best way to make people feel sorry for her. She continues to create a scene around herself because she is of another race, like her mother, Delilah. Peola is not visibly different from the other kids at school. After, it is not until her mother comes to drop off Peola¡¯s rain boots that she is revealed as a colored person. Fredi Washington was a very promising talent but went nowhere because she had the look of a white person. She had shifted away from the public¡¯s eyes.
