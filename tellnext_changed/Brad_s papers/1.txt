What are the central arguments of the reading for this week?

¡ñ The central argument is that in the early days of cinema, animators created trickster characters because of their own ever-present place in society. This boils down to two arguments, the first one being the ending of silent spaces and the second one being that more transitional places were becoming prevalent. He also talked about the ¡°prologue, presentation, and epilogues¡± that were happening in the early days of cinema. But overall the author presented the problem society was having at that time of one being racism. He also briefly talked about the attempt to return animation to the stage.

Based on the evidence presented by the author, do you find this argument compelling?

¡ñ I found the argument compelling because of the evidence and facts that the author talked about. I also thought that it was a fascinating read because I for one never knew the struggles that African Americans had in the early twentieth century. One point in which Mr. Sammond was attempting to make was when he was going into detail about ¡°Vaudeville.¡± I thought he was particularly clear at this point. That was one of the short films I watched on Wednesday. After laboriously going through every detail about Ko-Ko and Max¡¯s adventure, he said, ¡°Max [Fleischers] yells at Ko-Ko to get off the stage, calling him a ¡®HAM¡¯ (a term associated with the ham fat used to remove blackface)¡± (Sammond). This attention to detail illustrates his argument completely.
