					Paper Proposal

I will look at Hattie McDaniels. I will analyze her historical role as a female black actress playing a maid. My scholarly sources are (1) Hattie McDaniel: The Landmark of an Era," New Journal and Guide, March 9, 1940, (2) Sources on lesbian subjectivities for the production of lesbian of color identity formation through literature, art,  lm, or documentation: An annotatated bibliography". CUNY Academic Works,(3) Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, The Politics of Respectability," chapter 7 in Righteous Discontent: The Black Women Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880-1920 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1994),  185-229 and (4) Finding the Oscar" W. Burle e Carter, GW Law Faculty Publications I   will choose three sources for my article because I have not read them word for word yet but I plan to in the upcoming weeks. My movie will be Gone with the Wind, I have always had my interest peaked by Hattie McDaniel character. This was a historical movie in which I have wanted to watch because I love films that are apart of American  history. Unfortunately, I never had the time. In this paper, I hope to answer the following questions: who was Hattie McDaniel? Why were black people in history so angry with a black maid? Why was the role of a maid such a popular role for black women in the 1930s? We have already seen Louise Beavers' performance and now I will watch Hattie McDaniel as a servant.
