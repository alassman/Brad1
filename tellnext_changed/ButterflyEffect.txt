If anyone finds this, then I guess my plan did not work and I am already dead...

I do not understand... did this?
The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies. It extremely sophisticated for a seven-year old. Some of the corpses have been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically correct.

Mommy lives far away but she comes and visits.

Look, , I am sure he will test negative for brain disorders. But there something else you can try to monitor his memory.

Anything.

And the bad news?

Unfortunately, we have got nothing to work with. It harder playing detective now.

But you must have something to go on?

If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.

But he seven. What kind of stress can he have?

Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend dad.

Come on, I doubt the answer that simple.

You'd be surprised how often they are.

Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I have been putting it off.

 eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that hinder  movement. Finally  sits.

Blocking his view of the ceiling is , whose face is now monstrous with rage, and whose cuffed hands are wrapped around  throat, choking the life out of him.

(through clenched teeth)
I...love...you.
Suddenly, ORDERLIES tackle  from both sides and wedge a baton under his jaw to wrench him away.  frantically struggles to rescue  from  clutches.

No response.

Why do not you fucking kiss her, Prince Charming!

How long was I out?
He gets no answer from , who stands in the exact same spot.  is nowhere in sight and the sound is of  weeping.  spins to face her.

?! Are you okay? Where Crockett?

Outside the truck,  waves to , tears spilling shamelessly down her cheeks.  reaches behind his seat and opens a large cardboard box. It is filled with past journals. He finds the most recent journal, uncaps a pen and writes something.
Finished he presses the journal to the window.

PROFESSOR CARTER
Time! Please place your blue books on my desk before you leave.
 grabs his psychology textbook from under his seat, gets up and turns in his exam.
PROFESSOR CARTER
How'd you do, ?
 flashes a confident smile.

I am not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlof condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
PROFESSOR CARTER
(laughing)
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?

(shrugging)
Hey, I got no choice.
Professor Carter nods solemnly, obviously in the know.

By  bed is a bookshelf filled with books on amnesia, memory loss, fugues, hypnotism and other related bands.
 roommate, , 19, is a completely punked out Gothic boy who weighs 300 pounds. He currently hands a black lacy dress to CRICKET, 17, a pierced Goth co- ed. She slips the tattered dress on as  wipes his post-coital self off with a black tee-shirt.
 barges through the door, throwing his pscyh books on the bed and politely looking away from the half-naked girl.

Whoa. Smells like patchouli and...ass.

Cricket, meet my well-mannered roommate, .
Cricket puts on her Doc Martens as  watches the worms.
CRICKET
Yeah, you are the one who fucked up the bell-curve on my Anthropology final. Later, .

Nice to meet you, too.
As she leaves,  takes the black T-shirt by his wallet and throws it on  bed.

Here, bro. Found your T-shirt.

Get dressed, , you are taking me out for my birthday.

KRISTEN
So...which one of you has a pet worm?
 proudly steps forward.

Worms, plural.
KRISTEN
That so gross.

Talk to him about it, he got the fetish.

Actually, they are for a psych project. A study on memory.

Shit, better explain before all the excitement gives me a heart attack.

It an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.

Like Ozzy.
 giggles as  throws popcorn at  head.

Ten bucks says he eats it off the floor.
 seems oblivious to their taunts as  knocks the three-ball in the side.

You chop up the smart flatworm and feed it to the dumb one and presto, the dumb one suddenly knows the maze inside and out.
 walks past , putting his hand on her shoulder to squeeze by. The hand lingers longer than necessary and  does not mind. He sinks another ball.

Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm memories.

(thoughtfully)
That probably why Hannibal Lecter so smart.
A handful of popcorn hits  face. They all try to ignore Hunter and  jeers.

So what the point?

(setting up the eight)
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it will help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Another barrage of popcorn hits  jacket. Although his hand clenches on the cue. He meekly shuffles away to the opposite side of the pool table from the cackling geeks.

(intrigued)
So are you planning on becoming a doctor or something?
 casually takes the pool cue from .

No, I just do not want to lose my mind.
As  digests this,  carefully lines up his shot...The eight ball.
CRASH!!! The cue ball intentionally jumps the table, rocketing into the pitcher of beer on the Greek table. They are all soaked with beer and debris.
Just as they begin to rise,  smashes the cue stick on the table, WHISTLING innocently (while now brandishing a spear). They sit the fuck down.
Kristin, impressed, casually wraps her arm around  waist. He smiles coolly, it nothing.

Charisma and eyeliner go a long way, I guess. Wanna beer?

Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.

Yeah. I have been keeping journals since I was seven.

(respectfully)
Wow...read something.
 chugs his beer and sits next to her on the bed and puts his arm around her. Very drunk.

No way, I'd be too embarrassed.
 teasingly runs her fingers over his smooth torso.

Then keep drinking, worm-boy. You are too uptight.
 stops short.

Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you ca not shake it. And I do not want everyone thinking I have got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?

(laughing)
Deal. Now read me something.
 hands him a book marked "AGE 13". He flips it open to a random place and takes the beer from her hand.

(re: her beer)
For courage.
 takes and finishes her beer and begins reading. As he reads, he seems more and more on the verge of passing out.

It like my mind refused to believe what it was seeing. Hearing Crockett make those awful screams... Just writing about it gives me the shivers.
Color drains from  face as he realizes what he reading. He looks over at , who kisses him.

Come on, go on...

It was like  was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I could not really call human.
As  reads, the world seems to ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY VIBRATE around him LIKE A TUNING FORK. His voice becomes distant and SOUNDS ECHO around him like distant memories resurrecting themselves...

Only now,  almost seems caught off-guard to suddenly find himself running at full speed. He stumbles and falls to his knees at  feet.

What the hell is going on?
Before an answer comes,  smiles at his good fortune and swings the plank, hitting  head.  is sent sprawling backwards, his forehead bleeding freely.

 moves toward the gunny sack, lifts it and tugs desperately on the rope that traps Crockett inside.

I ca not undo the rope!
 spins around and flashes an evil smile.

Drop it or I will slit your mother throat in her sleep.
As if on cue,  does exactly as he told. His eyes begin to glaze over.
, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of strength, grabs  foot and holds on.

I got him, . Help Crockett!
 remains frozen in place.  yanks his leg back, breaking  grip.  groans on the ground in a writhing heap.
 voice hitches. His eyes water from pent up frustration.

Listen to me good, . There a million other sisters in the world. You did not have to fuck with mine.

Oh my God! No! No!

Wake up, idiot. It was just a dream.
She stands and angrily puts on her jacket.

(freaked out)
It did not feel like a dream.

Maybe because they never do.
(sarcastic)
So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
 does not even hear her. After getting his bearings, he grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded.
  CAR - SUNRISE

  HOUSE - DAY

PULL BACK TO REVEAL
The room is filled with model airplanes. Hundreds of them.
A KNOCK on  bedroom door. , grayer, fatter, opens the door and escorts  inside. She glares at  while pretending to be cheerful.

I have got a surprise for you, . You will never guess who here.
 looks up to see , his jaw drops.
ANGLE ON 
Looking around, shocked to see:
PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ROOM. Nothing has changed in the past seven years. The same kids' toys, posters and comic books.
AS WE PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND TO 
We see he working on the model again, in his own world. The window of opportunity for conversation has closed.

Hey, uh, it me. .
Silence.  frowns.

What that you are working on? A model?
Nothing.

Well, you look busy, so maybe I should make this quick. I'd totally understand if you did not want to get into this right now, but that day at the junkyard, could you help me remember what happened? Any details?
No response.  picks up a model airplane from the desk.

I could not cut the rope.

(containing excitement)
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?

Drop it or I will slit your mother throat in her sleep.
, startled, drops the model on the desk. An epiphany.

Jesus Christ. It really happened.
 stares out the window.

What if I can get back all my lost memories with my journals.
With lightning speed,  jumps from his desk and unexpectedly shoves  IN TO THE WALL. Squadrons of hanging planes crash to the floor.  digs his fingers into  shoulder.

Make one peep and I swear it will be your last, motherfucker.
 is terrified. Then  suddenly moves back and begins working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away.  is speechless.
The door bursts open.  looks at the smashed model airplanes by  feet.  ignores her accusing stare.

Well, thanks for seeing me, man. I should not have waited so long.
When  does not respond,  hustles  back into the hallway.
  DORM - NIGHT
 pulls a dozen journals from beneath his bed and begins pouring over them. Nearby,  empties a can of hairspray into his Mohawk.

You really think he wanted to kill you?

All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
He finds something he looking for, marks the page with a yellow post-it note marked, BLACKOUT and sets the book in a separate pile.
As he sets the next journal on the bed, it automatically opens up to a place where the spine was bent. Staring up at him is the message:
 DIARY
I will come back for you.
 looks overcome by guilt.
LATER THAT EVENING:
  DORM - NIGHT
 has now organized a pile of five journals. He selects an entry, begins reading and suddenly closes the journal. Fear covers his face. He holds one of his hands up and is not surprised to see it trembling.
He opens his journal again and reads out loud.

(reading aloud)
The last thing I remember before the blackout was holding my hands over  ears...
(his voice slowly fades)
I think I was more focused on her hands on mine than the mailbox across the street...
His own words grow reverberant, distant. Furthermore, the walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before.
FLASH! SMASH CUT TO:
 HALPERN HOME - DAY - 1995
, ,  and , all thirteen, watch the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation.
When  comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt, SMOLDERING.
The mailbox...tick-tock, tick-tock...Like a staring contest.

Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?

Yeah, you do that, .
Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway.
HALPERN, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of the car and walks to the mailbox.
Across the street,  digs his fingers into the nerves of  shoulder.

Make one peep and I swear it will be your last, motherfucker.
 words make  flinch. From inside the car, a BABY begins to cry. Halpern walks back to the car.
 looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the lit cigarette to the ground. He pulls up his shirt revealing a fresh BURN MARK on his stomach.
HALPERN
How my sweet girl? Awww, you need a change, do not you honey?
Halpern picks her up and carries her to the house. AS the mother unlocks the front door to the house, the kids break into wide smiles of relief. But wait...
The mother remembers the mail and carries the baby back to the mailbox. Now  is the only one left still smiling.
HALPERN
You want to open the door, honey?
The baby fumbles with the mailbox door handle for a moment -
ANGLE ON KIDS' FACES
BOOM!!!
The blast is deafening. ,  and  watch the results in stunned horror.

C amon! Run!!
 and  slowly back away in shock and begin to run a few steps when they realize that  is not with them.

? Come on!

Oh my God oh my God...
 does not seem to hear, his eyes fixated on the crimson road.  and  double back and grab him. They try to make him break out into a run, but  feet drag limply against the ground. Both  and  grab an arm and begin to run with  through the woods.

  DORM - NIGHT

Sounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room. Looking sick and pale, he lifts his shirt to see a NEW SCAR from the cigarette burn.

What the hell?
In the next bed,  head, wrapped in a blanket, pops up from above a NAKED GESELA waist.

Christ, man. You wanna clean that up before I lose my appetite here?
 sits upright in bed and begins writing in the margins of the journal.
 DORM LOBBY - DAY
The lobby is decorated with colorful streamers, balloons, posters and banners announcing PARENTS' WEEKEND.
Carefree STUDENTS and their parents carry shopping bags toward the bustling elevators.  leans against the side of a pay phone, holding his ear to drawn out the noise.

Yes, hello, uh, , this is  .
(rolling eyes)
I know. I am sorry about that. But I really need to speak with him.
She obviously hung up on him. Suddenly, a HAND grabs his shoulder. It Professor Carter.
PROFESSOR CARTER
Whoa! Did not mean to scare you, . Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.

Oh, fine I guess. It been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I have not...
PROFESSOR CARTER
I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido in full swing, right?  shrugs and forces a smile.
PROFESSOR CARTER
Just do not drop the ball, okay?

I wo not let you down, Professor Carter.
Carter waves to another student and her parents and walks away.
 FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
A waiter clears the dishes away from  and  table.
REVEAL 
Her hair now has gray streaks. As she signs for the bill, she leans over and kisses  on the cheek.

Please, mom. People will talk.

I ca not help it. I am just so proud of you. You have got the highest grades in all of your classes.

Did Da -  - get good grades?

(smiling)
Please. He got straight A without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.

Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
 smile fades.

Why do you ask?

No, it just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.

When he was around your age...almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
 tries not to react.

I could not tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...

Sure...

And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...

What? What could he do?
 shakes her head.

Forget it. It nothing. He was far too sick by then.
 nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface.
  DORM - NIGHT
 hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room looking for a certain book. , lying on his bed, quietly watches  with growing concern.

(reading aloud)
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but  took his shirt off --

What the fuck are you doing?

Shhh! I need quiet for this.
 jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away.

Are you stupid or what?

What?

Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there a reason why you have repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
 begins scanning the journal entry. A bitter laugh.

Yeah, man. I'd think twice about this. You could wake up a lot more fucked up than you are now.
He hands the journal back to .  opens it and begins reading it silently. His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in defeat.

BOSS
Can we get through one goddamned day without you breaking something?
 face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order. She is humiliated and  leans back against a pay phone so that she ca not see him watching her.
As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a CUSTOMER pinches her ass.  closely studies her reaction to the offense. She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer.  backs out uncomfortably.
 RIDGEWOOD DINER - NIGHT
 struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she exits.  steps out of the shadows. She startled at first, but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged.

God, ! I never thought I'd see you again. How have you been?

Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...

No, . I do not know. It been a long time. Fill me in.

I am going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom good...
 nods and they walk down the street. She reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes.

(declining)
Not since we were kids.

I have stopped a hundred times.

So how ?

(takes a long drag)
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale Autobody.
 nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question.

You still live with your dad?
Her face is betrayed by a slight tick.

No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.

Wow. That must have taken some courage.

Not if you remember my dad.

Could not you have moved in with your mom?

(shaking her head)
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But...whatever.
They walk in silence for a moment.

Actually, , the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.

(brightening)
Me? Are you kidding? Why?

Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?

Of course.

Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinds like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.

Well, sure. I will try to remember. Shoot.

When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?

(cold)
What do you want to know, ?

It just...did he...what happened in the basement?

It was a long time ago.

I know, but...

(cold)
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?

No, but I think something really bad might have happened to us.
 stops walking and crushes her cigarette.

Is there a point to any of this?
 features shift from inquisitory to tenderness. He steps closer to  and softly strokes her face. She flinches at first, but remains in the same spot.

Whatever happened, it was not our fault. You know we could not have stopped it.
 begins to tremble. Tears flow.

Look, . This may sound like bullshit coming from a guy who has not spoken to you in seven years...
She moves her face away from his hand.

But you were seven years old and there nothing you could have done to deserve...
Her face collapses and she turns away.

(defeated)
Just shut up, . You are wasting your breath.

You ca not hate yourself just because your dad a twisted freak.

Who are you trying to convince, ?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything all better now? Well fuck you, ! Nothing gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!

If I was so wonderful, , why did not you ever call me? Why'd you leave me here to rot?!
She turns and runs away.  looks sick with guilt.

It been said that a person life is little more than the sum of his experiences. If that true, then I am not sure I know who I am anymore.

Let go.

 face is flushed with rage. He walks behind  and cups his hands tightly around her ears. She ca not hear anything now.

What time is it?

It time for you to stand where the hell I told you.

Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you are going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
The mature speech seems completely surreal coming from a seven-year old.  looks around the room as if he the butt of some sick joke.

(stunned disbelief)
What happened to -- How are you doing that?

(voice rising)
It will change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it will lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.

Who - who are you?

Let just say you are being closely watched, . Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat  like...oh, let say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?

Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I will flat out castrate you.

Do not you ever touch me again.

I - I wo not.

I am cold. And I am putting on my clothes.
As he leaves to pick up her clothes,  grins.

What you need to do is discipline your son , because the kid one sadistic pup.

Finally the memory assault is over.  groans in pain as blood trickles from his nose.
An arm reaches over and touches his shoulder.
 (O.S.)
Honey, are you all right?
 whips around to see  watching him. Not only is  alive, but she a ravishing beauty.
 lurches back from the shock of seeing  and falls to the floor. She sees  nose bleed and her eyes go wide.

Oh my God, . You are bleeding! Look at you!
, still stunned, can do little but stare from the floor.

(transfixed by her)
Jesus, , you are...
(looks around)
Incredible.

(purring)
Mmmm... You' give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
He stands in the middle of her bedroom, surrounded by sorority plaques and pink preppy decor.
, hardly able to take his eyes off her as she hands him a tissue. He reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed and comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and brown suede jacket.

Where...where are my clothes?

Those are your clothes, silly.
 frowns with distaste, grabs a towel and heads out.
WE FOLLOW HIM INTO:
 SORORITY BATHROOM - MORNING
At the sink,  washes the blood off his face and looks at his reflection in the mirror. A nearby shower SHUTS OFF.

This is too amazing! Un-fucking-real!
WOMAN VOICE (O.S.)
I wish I could get so excited about a nose bleed.
 turns around and sees , one of the sorority brats from the bar, exit the shower naked.

Whoops. Sorry. My bad.

Somehow, the world seems brighter now. Even the colors seem more vibrant when compared to the somewhat grimmer world we have known.
MANY STUDENTS wave to  and call his name. He ca not remember all their names but it kinda cool being the BMOC.
 takes a long look at her and becomes curious.

Hey, uh, do not go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?

Well I remember he had one...but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?

I dunno.
(goofy smile)
Just being weird.
 playfully sweeps her leg around to kick him on the ass, then smiles as if a ghost must have done it.

Such a goofus. See you tonight.

Hi, Mom and, uh, Chuck. Just calling to say hi and well, call me.

 COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY

PROFESSOR CARTER
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.

(quietly)
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
PROFESSOR CARTER
And you are...?

(disappointed)
 .
PROFESSOR CARTER
The answer 'no', . Now take a seat. The exam about to begin.
 walks up the aisle and takes a seat. As he sits down, someone puts his ARM menacingly around  throat.
 flinches, turns around and sees Hunter, the frat guy  assaulted the other night at Dirty Hank bar.

Leave me alone, asshole. I did not lay a hand on you, okay?
Hunter bursts out laughing.
HUNTER
, you are hysterical. You study for this?

(awkward)
We will find out soon enough.
HUNTER
(laughing)
Me neither.
Hunter surreptitiously hands  a cheat-sheet to the exam.  face brightens.

You are kidding. Are these the answers?!
HUNTER
Damn, , on the D.L.

(holding it lower)
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for  tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
HUNTER

 SORORITY BEDROOM - NIGHT
 and  have just finished having sex. She seems incredibly satisfied, but he looks slightly uncomfortable.

Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks/

So it did not feel...weird?

Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
She giggles and snuggles into him. He grateful for her affection, but still looks uneasy. The PHONE RINGS and he automatically answers it.

Yellow.
Silence on the other end. More silence.

Fuck 'em.
As  hangs up, he and  share a giggle and he resumes snuggle position.

What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?

(laughs)
As if my dad could have stopped me from seeing you. What he gonna do to me?  smiles to himself. And hugs her tighter.

You think we will always be together?
For the first time she looks at him with concern.

That is the plan, right? Hell or high water?
He in heaven, but plays it cool.

Just making sure.
DISSOLVE TO:
 FRAT HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - DAY
The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around , their clothes covered in dirt, food and what might be vomit.

Order, order. So all you rushes know what you have got to do for me?
THETA CHI PLEDGE
(correcting him)
Pledges, Sir Brother , Sir.

Pledges, rushees, same difference. Now this is a one-time deal. You do all this for me and I will never give you shit again. Promise.

I do not understand, where are you taking me?

You will see.
 FRAT HOUSE - ROOF - CONTINUOUS The wooden door to the rooftop swings open, revealing  and .  is dazzled by what she sees:
The entire roof is decorated with fairy-lights, Chinese lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles. And elegant romantic table for two awaits them, flanked by twelve FORMALLY DRESSED SERVANTS (previously seen pledges) who respectfully stare ahead with the utmost class.
Two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by.  applauds and laughs with delight.

I do not know what to say. It beautiful.

Go on. Sit down.
AS she takes a step toward the table - FLOWER PETALS shower down on her. She looks up to see TWO MORE PLEDGES standing on ladders, delicately tossing pedals.
 looks overwhelmed as she sits down.

Why are you doing all this for me?

Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely. Her eyes tell him she feels the same way. A magical moment.
And they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it might as well be their first ever --
Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time.
HUNTER

SENIOR BROTHER
Someone trashed your car.
The moment gone.  and  exchange worried looks.
 FRAT HOUSE - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
 runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked at the bottom of the hill. His face collapses.
 car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass. The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has bee mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the roof.
The most unnerving thing, however, is a SPIKED LEATHER DOG COLLAR hangs off the rearview mirror.
By now a crowd has gathered.  runs up to people.

(panicked)
Did you see who did this? You see anyone?
No one will answer with anything more than a shrug.
HUNTER
Probably them Pika fuckers.
But  knows better. She stares at the collar.

How could he get away with this? Right in front of the goddamn frat house!
A SENIOR BROTHER angrily calls him from the lawn.
SENIOR BROTHER
Frat house? Hey man, would you call your "country" a "cunt"?
 shudders and  puts his arms around her.

Do not. He probably watching.
 FRAT HOUSE -  BEDROOM - NIGHT
 leads  into his bedroom and shuts the door.  ca not help but look under the bed. No one. He then locks the door, reaches into his desk and finds a tiny canister of Pepper Spray.

It my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.

Might'a been nice.
(re: pepper spray)
Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.

Please, . Do not even joke. He would not hurt you. He just trying to scare you away from me.

(shaking the cannister)
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.

(quietly)
It not his fault, . You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.

Do not give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.

(quietly)
My father never laid a hand on me. It like the prick saved it all up for .

Fine, then. We will let campus security deal with him.
 COLLEGE QUAD - NIGHT
 and  walk through the all-but-deserted campus.  seems especially paranoid. In the distance, some guy vomits loudly.

Are you okay?

What do you mean?

It just...you have been acting kinda strange, you know?

Like how?

I do not know. You seem...different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You do not even walk the same.

I walk differently?

I ca not put my finger on it, but everything a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...

I know I have been actin strange lately. It just that... I do not want anything to happen to us.
The guy along the path gags loudly into the bushes.  and  instinctively avert their eyes. Suddenly,  ears perk and she stops walking mid-stride.

Wait. Something not right. Is not that your jacket?

What?
The guy, wearing  brown suede jacket, suddenly springs to his feet, revealing his face for the first time.

.
 has grown in the last seven years. He has long, greasy hair and some tattoos. He holds a TIRE  (a short, steel bat for truckers) menacingly in his right hand.
 stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat pockets.

Leave us alone you sick fuck!

Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You have done nicely for yourself, . Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you are fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.

Shut up, !

Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
 takes a few practice swings with the tire .

What the hell are you doing?

It was not enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who did not think I was a piece of shit.

(suppressing panic)
No one thinks you are a piece of shit, .

Right, . I believe you just said "sick fuck."
 rushes  and bashes him with the tire  in the shoulder and ribs.  goes down. As  prepares to bash his brains in,  whips out the Pepper Spray and nails  in the face.
 reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free hand.  struggles to his feet and circles around , keeping a distance as he douses  with Pepper Spray.  screams.  blindly stumbles around, madly swinging the tire .  charges forward in an uncontrollable rage, rips the weapon out of  hands and sprays a lethal does of pepper spray into  open mouth.

, stop! You are gonna kill him!

He a fucking maniac!
 knocks  down with the tire .  screams and tries to hold  back, but he easily wrestles free of her. She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad.

He ruined  life --
 kicks  hard in the ribs.  pushes a button on the "Blue Light" lamp post and an ALARM WAILS.

He killed Crockett --
(kicks him)
Murdered that woman and her baby!
(kicks again)
And he trying to kill me, ! He trying to fucking kill me!
 raises the tire  for a final attack and swings down OFF CAMERA. CRUNCH!
 sees what he done and drops the weapon, horrified.  sees what  done to her brother. And stops cold when she sees the damage to .
 rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a crablike fashion.
SIRENS come racing to the quad.  looks away from  limp body. Collapses to the ground and begins to weep.

 stares at  disinterestedly as  makes up his bed on the top bunk.

First time?
 nods glumly.

Best not bitch up. Wind up someone luggage that way.

(desperate)
Can you protect me?

Jesus himself could not make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
A BUZZER SOUNDS.  leaves the cell without another word.

...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. HE sure he can get you off on self- defense, so if you are patient.

How long will I be in here?

I do not know. These things take time.

How  doing? She all right?
 look tells him to look for hope elsewhere.

What about my journals, Mom? Did you bring the ones I asked for?
 nods, holding up two comp books. "AGE 7" and "AGE 13".

I found these. The others are still in storage.

Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!

Fine. You will get them, . But I think it far more important to focus on your case right now.

Sure, Mom. You are right. Just try to tell  I am sorry.
And officer signals  and points to his watch.

I am not gonna lose you, kiddo. Promise me you will hang on, Ev.

, totally violated, turns white with rage.
KARL
Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.
 stands there, stunned, unable to react when --
Another Neo-Nazi, RICK, swats  journals out of his hands and onto the floor. Life springs back into  as he rushes for the journals. He and Rick grab the journals at the same time. A minor tug of war.

Let go! They are mine!
Rick tears them away,  coming up with only a few torn pages.  sees the damage and goes mental.

Motherfucker!
 swings at Rick and misses. INMATES CHEER! It on! Rick lunges for , a brief and painful scuffle ensues, the journals getting trampled. Suddenly -- The sounds of COCKED RIFLES echo through the air. The fight stops instantly as Rick and  look up to see --

Karl makes himself visible among them, holding a journal. He reads:
KARL
(from  journal)
Today I found my grandfather death certificate. HE died in a nut house, just like my father. Mom denies it, but she thinks I am gonna end up the same way...
The other Supremacists start laughing and calling "looney" and "nut job."  rushes past them and they make chicken clucks at him.
 PRISON YARD - DAY
 and  sit on BLEACHERS that overlook the other prisoners working out.

 slides closer to  and stares at the Jesus Christ tattoos all over ' back.

You are religious , you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"

Straight up.

Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.

Shit. I knew you were crazy.

I ai not bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.

Pack of smokes says I can prove it to you.
 is suddenly interested.
  CELL - LATER
 holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes up a conversation.  looks dumbfounded.

So when I am out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.

You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Their conversation stops when a convict rolls a mail cart by,  looking up expectantly.

Anything today?
CONVICT
Yep. Just not for you.
Disappointed,  turns back to . Holds up his journal entry.

Just tell me if anything weird happens.

Weirder than this?

Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
 studies the page.
JOURNAL ENTRY
On Wednesday I got in trouble for a drawing that I did not do. Mommy wont let me see it.

 sees some paper spindles sitting on  desk. AS he heads over to them,  firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own desk.

No monkey business, . Sit still and finish your drawing.
, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper. HE smiles mischievously, and grabs some colored pencils.

That great everyone! Just imagine anything you want to be. There are no limits.
Soon enough, an image emerges:  holding a knife, stands over a heap of several dead inmates Karl and Rick.
When done, he sneaks over to  desk, where the two paper spindles sit. The metal needles reach up and skewer a number of paper notes and messages.  looks over to see  holding up his drawing, horrified.

(musically)
Oh, lllllll?
She looks over in time to see  using all of his seven-year old strength to WHIP his hands down toward the spindles!
The moment before his palms reach them there a brief instant where SOUNDSCAPES COLLIDE and the world behind him VIBRATES.
AND WE are BACK TO:
  PRISON CELL - DAY - 2002

Oh sweet Jesus. It true. It a miracle! A miracle!
 looks up to see  staring at him with reverence.

Your hands. The stigmata!
 looks to see two scars in the center of each palm.

What did you see? What did it look like?

(laughing)
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!

So you believe me?
 simply stares at him, awestruck, and hands over a box of cigarettes.
 KARL CELL - CONTINUOUS
 nervously approaches. A CREW of Aryans block his path.

I want to make a deal.
The Aryans laugh, make discrete eye contact with Karl, who grins and signals to let  pass.
 KARL CELL - CONTINUOUS
Karl and Rick wait expectantly as  nervously enters. They say nothing, relishing the fearful silence.

Look. I am new to all this but I think I get how things work. You gotta join a gang or else end up dead meat.
They continue to stare.

Well it sure ai not gonna fucking be with no niggers or spics. So how do we do this? You gotta work your way up, and I am the new guy.
(looking ill)
So...should I...I mean, do I suck your dicks right now?
Karl and Rick exchange looks.
KARL
Is your blood pure?

(angry)
I ai not no fucking kike if that what you mean.
Rick stands. All muscle.
RICK
Let see what you got. And watch the fucking teeth or you will be leaving without 'em.
 nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees. Karl and Rick lower their pants to their ankles.  looks miserable, about to do the deed when --

Bulldozes past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall and jamming a shank into Karl crotch!
Rick instantly charges , but trips on the pants around his ankles. , anticipating Rick fall, stomps Rick face before snatching his journals from Karl shelf.
 frantically flips through them, hunting for something, as the other WHITE SUPREMACISTS charge the cell.

!
 drops Karl writhing body to the floor and presses his girth against the cell door.
 locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as the other supremacists force the door open --
 focuses on the words. Chanting quickly.

We took the woods behind the junkyard just to make sure we would not bump into . We had not seen the smoke yet.
WORDS from the entry begin to SHIMMER. REVERBERANT SOUNDS OF BARKING break the sound barrier and the image of Aryans storming the cell behind him become a frenetic blur -
SMASH CUT TO:
 JUNKYARD WOODS - DAY - 1995
, thirteen again, comes to in the woods.  stumbles at first, then rights himself. He seems strangely exhilarated. A sinister victory smile.

Rot in hell you fucking animals.
 and , walking by his side, do a double take.  shrugs "just kidding" and looks around, getting his bearings. He whips his hand out and stops them.

Wait. Before we --
He suddenly notices  who now no longer looks an awkward and unkempt tomboy, but rather a vibrant and feminine young girl. Whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering before, she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles.
 remembers his mission and darts over to a JUNK PILE.

We need something to cut open the sack!
 and  stare at him, concerned for his sanity.
 roots through the trash until he finds something: a razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long.  offers it to .

I want you to take this, . Today your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --

. Stop it. It not the time.

(frantic)
Now the only time!
(to )
Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --

What are you talking about?

You are acting crazy!

(desperate; to )
Please. If you have ever trusted me before, trust me on this one.
 places the metal shard in  hand.

Cut the rope.
 slowly follows  as he bolts away.
 JUNKYARD - LATER
 groans on the ground, writhing.  voice hitches, eyes watering from pent up frustration.

Listen to me good, ...

I will do whatever you want. You do not want me to ever see  again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they will stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
 words hit home and  anger slowly dissipates. A look of understanding passes between them. Gratitude, even.
 looks at the sack and begins to untie it.  comes screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell! With all of the force he can muster, he jams the metal shard all the way through  throat!
 clutches his throat, gagging in blood.  surveys the scene in shock:

Oh fuck, , no!
 drops to the floor, Indian style, wipes the dirt in his hands and freezes up completely.  wakes up and SCREAMS when she sees blood spurt from  throat.
Meanwhile, Crockett escapes from the sack.

He sits upright in bed and takes in his surroundings. When suddenly,  clutches his head in severe pain.

Color memories of  sorority fade to BLACK and WHITE and dissipate.
 FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT - 2002
Memories of  vandalized car fade to BLACK and WHITE and dissipate.

A new image overwhelms the others: , 13, with dark, soulless eyes wearing a straight-jacket in a padded room.
BACK TO :
  DORM - DAY - 2002
 eyes roll back in his head. He shakes uncontrollably and blood pours from his nose.
 opens the door, sees  convulsing and jumps back in horror. He scans the hallways for assistance.

Someone call 9-1-1!
  LABORATORY - DAY
 lies on an examining table undergoing another series of CAT-scans. The machines are now state of the art and the lab room has been redecorated.
  OFFICE - DAY
 nervously chews her fingernails as she watches  post CAT-scan results on the light box. A young nurse pushes , in a wheelchair, into the doctor office.

Okay, doc. What the damage? How much time have I got?

Cute, .

It a little complicated. I have not seen results exactly like these before.

Are you sure? Not even with my father?
 and  exchange looks.

Actually, these tests were not available twenty years ago.

So what did you find.
 points to the CAT-scan slides, specifically, to the outer lining of  brain.

This is where we are finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.

(nonplussed)
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
 stares ahead. Transfixed by the slides.

I have never seen anything like this. I have compared these to the ones taken last year, and there evidence of severe hemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction.
 stares at him blankly.  impatiently "pops wheelies" in the wheel chair.

What does that mean for ?

(to )
He saying it like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. at about the gist of it, doc?
 nods, awed by  effortless interpretation.  springs out of the wheelchair and stretches his legs.

(to )
Mind if I wait in the car? The lighting here bugs my eyes.
 nods.  shakes  hand.

Well, it nice seeing you again. But you know, people to see, things to read...
 shoots  an apologetic look.  heads out the door, accidentally knocking  jacket to the floor. He shrugs apologetically and re-hangs it.
  CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Outside the office,  inspects  KEYS and attached SECURITY CARD and smiles.  covertly winds himself through the maze of corridors, careful not to be seen by the staff.
He finally sees a wing marked "CRIMINALLY INSANE".  look around to make certain he not being watched, then uses the security card to open the door. He looks in every room of the wing until he finds --
  -  ROOM - CONTINUOUS
 unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees.
 is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in tight leather restraints. The dark five o'clock shadow and his malicious grin radiate evil. His black and haunting eyes personify hate and murderous intent.
 seems neither surprised or happy to see . That is, if he aware of  presence at all...

Is there anything you need? Anything I can get you?
Nothing from .

What about the models, man? Bet I can get you a shitload of models up in here.
Still nothing. Not even a glance in his direction.  sighs and gives up.

Okay, . Just wanted to say "hi".
 turns around to leave.

You knew the whole time, did not you?
( spins around)
When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Did not you?!

(jaw dropped)
Y...yes. I guess I did.
 eyes seethe with hate.

Then you should be where I am. You should be where I am.

I was praying this curse would have ended with me.

But it did not. And now I need info to make things right again and you are the only one who can give it to me.

(frustrated)
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.

Who to say you ca not make things better?
 seems extremely upset to hear  say this.

You ca not play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.

Bullshit. I will send you a postcard when I have made everything perfect again.

WAITRESS
Just get out, didja?

Huh?
WAITRESS
(re: his arm)
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.

(defensively)
I come from a big family.
WAITRESS
Meant no offense.

None taken. Hey, uh, does   still work here?
WAITRESS

Sorry. Never heard of her.
  HOUSE - EVENING

Just shut the hell up already! Ca not a man get a little goddman peace in his own home!
( rings doorbell)
Oh, for Christ sake, now what?
 opens the door and sees .

Do not suppose you are here to sell cookies?
In a blur,  grabs  shirt and violently shoves him through the house and into a wall.

Good guess, fuckbag.

Remember me now? We had a great chat once when I was seven.

One question, fuckbag. Where can I find your daughter?
 SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT

 SEEDY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I am expecting someone.

Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
She looks around, waves him in.

If I knew you were coming I'd have cleaned the stains off the sheets.

His sincerity touches her.

Well, time is money, . So you...

Well, I guess I can spare ten minutes for an old friend, right?
Tears fall freely from  eyes.

So how tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.

I get it. You can drop it now.

(angry again)
Oh, I am sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?

No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I have been where you have been

Ha! Where that?

The bottom. When you are just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
 watches  silently.

What happened to you?

You would not believe me. I mean, people always say, "You would not believe me", but in this case, it not even worth trying.

I have seen some sickening shit. I do not blink twice anymore, especially in your case.

Why that?

Because you are...different.

Different? How?

Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that been gnawing at me for years.

Yeah?

On the bridge. How did you know that  had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.

Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?

 DINER - NIGHT

You are right, , I do not believe you.

I never thought you would. That why I have never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.

I am the only person you have told? That a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?

I could not give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I am too tired to prove it to you.

Oh? There proof now?

(tired)
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?

Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.

Then forget that. How about...you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
 jaw drops.

Oh! And when you orgasm, your toes go numb. I am sure your clientele are not privy to that one.
 tries to conceal the surprise in her eyes.

I just thought you should know.

Know what?

That I did not leave you there to rot.
 flinches as if her should had been invaded, then her eyes fill with distrust and contempt.

There one major hole in your story.

Which is?

There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
She opens  wallet and leaves a twenty on the table.

Sure you do not want your wallet?

Do not think I will need it where I am going.

Off to change everyone life again, is that it? Maybe this time you will pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.

I am over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.

Well, do not give up now, Slick. You have already done so much for me. Hell, why do not you go back in time and save Halbern and her baby. Then maybe  would not freak out and ruin my family.
She gets up and puts on her coat.

Oh, here one! Go back when I am seven and fuck me in front of Daddy handicam, you know, straighten me out a bit...
She tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him and leaves.
  DORM - DAY
 enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar sounds of  having sex with another naked GOTHIC CO-ED. On  bed.

Get out. Both of you.

Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
 temper flares and he picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a wall above  head.

I am not saying it again.
 and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets and leave. Alone in the room,  looks under his bed and breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are intact. He sifts through them again. He finally finds the passage he needs. Something catches the corner of  eyes and he turns to examine it.
To the left of  Buddha statuette sits a large VOTIVE CANDLE that bears a portrait of Jesus Christ.

(humble)
Lord give me the strength and guidance I need to set things right.
As he begins reading a passage to himself, SOUNDS ECHO backward at us from another time and place. And the entire ROOM SHIMMERS around him -

Lady, stay back! Do not go near the mailbox!
Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically as she absently continues toward the mailbox.

I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!
 comes running across the street to  aid, and  shrugs and follows after him.

There a bomb in the mailbox. Get away!
, still running, cringes to hear  stupid confession and rolls his eyes at the situation.  positions himself between Halpern and the mailbox, frantically waving his hand at her to stay back, because she STILL COMING.

I will save you lady!
 takes a running dive at Halpern, perhaps a bit too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, but no major injuries.

Hey, there .
 spins around in fear. He sees , clean-cut, and handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads "Campus Crusade for Christ."  seems good-natured now, working hard and soliciting names for his list. He looks up as  rolls along and his eyes brighten to see .

I did what you said, man! We are pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we are going to have an Awareness Dance.

Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.

He saved Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
, now by a bench. Stops and sits. As she casually uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a granola bar and hands it to him.
His prosthetic hand crushes it. It crumbles to dust. She seems more confused.

Is something the matter?

(re: prosthetic arms)
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
She leans into him, gently feeding him her remaining bar.

? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?

Sure, , why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.

I was?

That why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.

I do not get it.

(feeding another bite)
When my folks split, they gave me and  a choice who we wanted to live with. I could not stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom I'd never see you again.

I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?

It crossed my mind from time to time.

(hopeful)
And...?

Well a lot of things cross my mind. I have always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom - we fall in love-get married-two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature-kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.

Then you think it might have worked out?

Why not? But that not how things wound up. I am with ,  your friend. And there it ends.
She looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically. Tears streak down  face as he speaks in a pleading tone.

Would it make any difference if I told you that no one could possibly love anyone as much as I love you?
